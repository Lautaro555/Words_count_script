# Worlds_count_script
The following script allows you to upload a .txt, .csv or excel file. 
* If it is a txt file, it automatically returns a bar graph where you can see the most frequent words in the text. 
* If it is a .csv or excel file, you must choose the column in which you want to analyze the frequency of words. 
* In the cell "Top N repeated words:" you must write the number of words you want to see in the graph, for example if you write 30 you get a graph with the 30 most frequent words.
